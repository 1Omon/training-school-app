            We believe that true mastery comes from doing, not just listening.
            Our curriculum emphasizes hands-on projects that challenge students
            to apply their knowledge in real-world scenarios. From developing
            functional web applications to building AI models, students leave
            with a strong portfolio showcasing their skills.
